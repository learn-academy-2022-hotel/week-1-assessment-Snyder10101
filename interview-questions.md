# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: It's like a step-by-step structure in which each internal link represents a return
It defines whether something is true or false, but there is a gray area where a catch all conclusion can be reached.

Researched answer: 

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a local program that is physical, Github is a remote platform also known as a cloud that is not physical.

Researched answer: When software is being developed, Git is used to keep track of changes to files and to coordinate work among programmers.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: (||) Pipes!

Researched answer: For a set of operands, (logical disjunction) also known as (||) operator is true if and only if one or more of its operands are true. It's usually used with boolean values. 

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: Code positions are represented by indexes, and variables are represented by values.

Researched answer: the position of a code is represented by an index, where as the value of a variable is represented by a value.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: In the same way that arrays and strings hold values and are assigned variables, they differ in that array elements are read one at a time by contrast, strings can be combined.
 
Researched answer: Strings and arrays both hold values and are assigned variables, but array elements must be read one at a time, whereas strings can be combined.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming involves two people, a driver and a navigator, The driver codes the information and the navigator provides it to the driver.

Researched answer: Team members are less likely to have  bias , pair programming's has sharing capabilities to compare thoughts or ideas. Pair programmers gain better communication skills as a result of this. This increases the partners total information by enhancing communication the project.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: javascript functions can be assigned to variables they can be passed into other functions as parameters and retuern creating a, "higher-order function" accepts or returns functions as parameters.

2. Jest: Jest is used for testing to ensure the codebase is correct and working and test any requirements that need to be met 

3. Objects: Object is self contained and has its own properties and types

4. Method: Methods are properties of objects that contain function definition mutators and accessors. 

5. Classes: Classes are a template for creating objects height, width, and other methods
